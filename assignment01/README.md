# Reducing Landfill Waste through Responsible Food and Clothing Consumption

## Faizah Mohamed - Digital Humanities 110 (Fall 2022)

**Description:** As the global population continues to increase, so does our usage of limited natural resources and other products that rely on these resources to be produced in the first place. Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production have been the main contributing factor to severe crises we are facing across the world today, including climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12). 

Two of the main areas where the global community demonstrates wasteful consumption patterns is when it comes to food and clothing. Over 30% of the world's food is getting wasted-- with 13.3% getting lost post-harvest but before reaching the market, and even more, ie. 17%, being wasted once in consumers' possession (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12). Unless the global community takes action to become responsible consumers, we will only exacerbate problems like food shortages and landfill growth, damaging the planet that has been so generous to us. 

This project will be centered around the corresponding UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 of Responsible Consumption and Production. In this assignment, specifically, I will evaluate the heuristics of two websites that contribute to this goal, to identify painpoints as well as useful design features that are present. I will then take the insight obtained from this evaluation and include the beneficial elements in my own design of a food donation/recycling website that intuitively inspires more responsible consumerism and production in society.

#### Detailed evaluation:

|Heuristic & Description|Evaluation|Recommendation| Severity Rating|
|-----------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
|**1. Visibility of system status:** Users should be able to quickly identify at any point where they are in the system/what state it is in with the help of relevant feedback.|**Good:** When you click different menu options, whether to Volunteer, Donate Food, or Find Food, that option will be highlighted. However, as you scroll down the website, the highlight color camoflages with the background at certain points, making the current status unclear. **Bad:** The Google Doc to signup for volunteering in other ways besides driving doesn't show how many pages there are to fill out in total, making it unclear for the user where in the signup process they are.|It would be helpful to have a black background perhaps for the navigation bar so that the text never blends into the rest of the background of the page.|num|
|**2. Match between system and the real world:** The design follows natural, real-world conventions and utilizes copy and concepts that are familiar to the user.|**Good:** All the navigation tabs and links are labeled in a way users would expect, with options to volunteer, donate, or receive food donations.|There are no improvements to be made in terms of the labels for actions users can take here.|num|
|**3. User control and freedom:** Users should have a clear, easy way to exit or undo an unwanted action. |**Bad:** When closing the Donate Money Window without donating, you're stuck on the tab without any way to navigate back to the home page from this tab, unless you close the window.|The webpage should be programmed such that clicking on the back arrow will close the current tab and take one back to the home page tab.|num|
|**4. Consistency and standards:** Established industry standards are followed, in addition to ensuring that there is consistency within the product itself.|**Bad:** All the sign-up forms are done through Google Docs, which is not typically used for professional services. Typically, sign-up forms will be built into the website itself.|They should make the sign-up forms in-built within the website.|num|
|**5. Error prevention:** The design should prevent errors from happening in the first place by removing error-prone conditions and providing warnings otherwise.|**Good:** The use of Google Forms validates sign-up input to a certain extent, preventing errors. The tool also saves progress as one fills up the form. **Bad:** When donating money, if the user inputs all the information but then closes the modal window, their information will be lost. Also, it's a risky situation because if they put a large donation amount but closed without submitting, no message is displayed reaffirming or asking for confirmation to exit this action. Now if there was an error in the system and the user accidentally got charged, it would be a big inconvenience. There are also no error notifications for invalid account number, routing number, etc. when donating using a bank account in the initial input state.|There should be an error message pop up for when users close the window without submitting their donation after inputting their information. |num|
|**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Users are provided with information that helps them recognize interface components, instead of having to remember and recall from elsewhere.|**Bad:** The website does not utilize icons and related pictures depending on the task that can be achieved from that page. All pages have the similar type of pictures.|something|num|
|**7. Flexibility and efficienty of use:** Shortcuts are enabled for experienced users. |**Good:** There are multiple ways to reach the donation and volunteer pages, which is helpful. **Bad:** When clicking the donate button in the top right, it doesn't take users directly to the donation form. You have to scroll down and click another button to get to that. Also, every new page you navigate to, a modal window pops up asking to join the mailing list. This is frustrating t because users will have to keep repeating the same action for the same purpose as they go through the website.Additionally, the organization within the web pages and nav bar should be more streamlined and grouped together. There is a different button for donating money (which stands out) and a different button for donating food.|something|num|
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Unnecessary and irrelevant information should be ommitted.|**Good:** All information included on the website is relevant. **Bad:** The testimonials on the Donate Money page take up a lot of space even though users often do not read all them in these kinds of contexts, so this should not be made to feel this significant.|something|num|
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Users are provided with error messages that clearly indicate the problem and suggested solution.|**Good:** Google Forms gives pretty clear error messages when validating input. **Bad:** In the donating money form, certain fields like credit card number are highlighted in red when an invalid input is given, but not for invalid bank account and routing numbers.|something|num|
|**10. Help and documentation:** Design in a way that users can navigate the interface intuitively. But if documentation is needed, provide it in the relevant area. |**Good:** There are FAQs listed for each action (Volunteer or Donate) in the footer of the page. **Bad:** The FAQs are not included in the drop down menu for each in the navigation bar at the top. Unless users scroll to the bottom, they might not be able to easily find these FAQs when they need it. There's also no search bar to search for these FAQs, making it difficult to get help when in confusion.|something|num|
