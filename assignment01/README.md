# Reducing Landfill Waste through Responsible Food and Clothing Consumption

## Faizah Mohamed - Digital Humanities 110 (Fall 2022)

**Description:** As the global population continues to increase, so does our usage of limited natural resources and other products that rely on these resources to be produced in the first place. Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production have been the major contributing factor to several global crises we are facing today, including climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12). 

Two of the main areas where the global community is involved in unsustainable consumption is when it comes to food and clothing. Over 30% of the world's food is getting wasted-- with 13.3% getting lost post-harvest before reaching the market, and an even greater percentage, ie. 17%, being wasted once in consumers' possession (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12). Unless the global community takes action to become responsible consumers, we will only exacerbate problems like food shortages and landfill growth, damaging the planet that has been so generous to us. 

This project will be centered around the corresponding UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 of Responsible Consumption and Production. In this assignment, I will evaluate the heuristics of two websites that contribute to this goal, to identify both painpoints and useful design features that are utilized. I will then take the insight obtained from this evaluation and keep this in consideration as I design my own food donation/recycling website that intuitively inspires more responsible consumerism in society.

### Competitor Analysis: [Foodcycle LA](https://www.foodcyclela.org/)
<img width="1439" alt="FoodcycleLA" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100739150/193945618-b3564ba8-d658-4156-90f5-c1f822f8a816.png">

This website aims to reduce food wastage by partnering with other services and organizations to provide individuals with the opportunity to donate food, money, or be a volunteer to collect food and take it to people in need. Foodcycle LA also provides resources to help those in need to find food. 

#### Overall evaluation: 
When it comes to functionality, all tasks (whether signing up for volunteering or donating) can be accomplished on the website without too much difficulty. However, the overall experience and ability to navigate through the website is not as smooth as it could be. Although all information on the website is relevant, it sometimes feels repetitive. So the website would mainly benefit from better organization and aesthetic fine-tuning.

#### Detailed evaluation:

|Heuristic & Description|Evaluation|Recommendation| Severity Rating|
|-----------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
|**1. Visibility of system status:** Users should be able to quickly identify at any point where they are in the system/what state it is in with the help of relevant feedback.|**Good:** When you click different navigation options, whether to Volunteer, Donate Food, or Find Food, the selected option will turn yellow. **Bad:** As you scroll down the website, the selected menu option camoflages with the yellow background at certain points, making the current position in the system unclear. Also, the Google Form to signup for volunteering in other ways besides driving doesn't show how many pages there are to fill out in total, making it unclear for the user how far along the signup process they are.|It would be helpful to have a dark background for the navigation bar so that the text never blends into the rest of the background of the page. I think there is also an option to show the page number on Google Forms, so this should be utilized as well.|1|
|**2. Match between system and the real world:** The design follows natural, real-world conventions and utilizes copy and concepts that are familiar to the user.|**Good:** All the navigation tabs and links are labeled in a way users would expect, with options to volunteer, donate, or receive food donations.|There are no improvements to be made here as the design generally is what the user would expect.|0|
|**3. User control and freedom:** Users should have a clear, easy way to exit or undo an unwanted action. |**Bad:** When closing the Donate Money Window without donating, you're stuck on that tab without any way to navigate back to the home page, unless you close the tab.|The webpage should be programmed such that clicking on the back arrow will close the current tab and take one back to the home page tab.|3|
|**4. Consistency and standards:** Established industry standards are followed, in addition to ensuring that there is consistency within the product itself.|**Bad:** All the sign-up forms are done through Google Docs, which is not typically used for professional services. Sign-up forms are typically built into the website itself.|Build the signup form within the website interface itself.|2|
|**5. Error prevention:** The design should prevent errors from happening in the first place by removing error-prone conditions and providing warnings otherwise.|**Good:** The use of Google Forms validates sign-up input to a certain extent, preventing errors. The tool also saves progress as one fills up the form. **Bad:** When donating money, if the user inputs all the information but then closes the modal window, their information is lost without warning. Also, it's a risky situation because if they put a large donation amount but closed without submitting, no message is displayed reaffirming or asking for confirmation to exit this action. Now if there was an error in the system and the user accidentally got charged, it would be a big inconvenience. There are also no error notifications for invalid account number, routing number, etc. when donating using a bank account in the initial input state.|There should be a message pop up for when users close the window after having input some information but not submitted it yet, such as "Are you sure you want to exit?" Some validation feature also needs to be utilized to check bank details when input.|3|
|**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Users are provided with information that helps them recognize interface components, instead of having to remember and recall from elsewhere.|**Bad:** The website does not utilize symbolic icons that make recognition easy, and solely relies on real pictures for the graphical component. These pictures can be hard to decipher with a one-second glance.|Utilize specific icons/graphical buttons for different tasks like donating food, versus donating money for example.|1|
|**7. Flexibility and efficienty of use:** Shortcuts are enabled for experienced users. |**Good:** There are multiple ways to reach the donation and volunteer pages, which is helpful. **Bad:** When clicking the donate button in the top right, it doesn't take users directly to the donation form. You have to scroll down and click another button to get to that. Also, every new page you navigate to, a modal window pops up asking to join the mailing list. This is frustrating because users will have to keep repeating the same action for the same purpose as they go through the website. Additionally, the organizational structure within the web pages and nav bar in enefficient as the drop-down menus for each nav button do not contain the full list of sections under that page. Users might also be confused as to why at the very top there is the stand-out yellow donate button as well as a separate donate food tab. It would make more sense for the donate food option to also be contained within the main section of the page that the donate button takes users to.|The nav bar at the top should have a more detailed drop-down menu for each section within that page. The Donate Food tab should just be labeled as Donate, with drop-down options to either donate food or donate money.|3|
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Unnecessary and irrelevant information should be ommitted.|**Good:** All information included on the website is relevant. **Bad:** The testimonials on the Donate Money page take up a lot of space even though users often do not read all of them in these kinds of contexts. The testimonials are made to feel more significant than they are, because when people come to the website to donate or volunteer, it's because they already intend to do so, so they wouldn't need more convincing. Font size also feels very big at times.|Reduce the size of the tesimonals section and perhaps incorporate a scrolling feature so that you can see one testimonial at a time and stop when you want. The font size for different areas of the pages should be made smaller based on the significance of that component.|1|
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Users are provided with error messages that clearly indicate the problem and suggested solution.|**Good:** Google Forms gives pretty clear error messages when validating input. In the donating money form, certain fields like credit card number are highlighted in red when an invalid input is given. **Bad:** No specific error messages are provided for invalid bank account and routing numbers.|Utilize some tests to validate all of the inputs that are not currently showing explicit validation.|3|
|**10. Help and documentation:** Design in a way that users can navigate the interface intuitively. But if documentation is needed, provide it in the relevant area. |**Good:** There are FAQs listed for each action (Volunteer or Donate) in the footer of the page, as well as descriptions throughout the page about how each respective task is fulfilled through the actions taken on the website. **Bad:** The FAQs are not included in the drop down menu for each in the navigation bar at the top. Unless users scroll to the bottom, they might not be able to easily find these FAQs when they need it. There's also no search bar to search for these FAQs, making it difficult to get help when in confusion.|Include FAQs for each action in the respective drop-down menu. It would also be helpful to have a chat bot in the corner so that users can get live help if needed.|2|

### Competitor Analysis: [2nd STREET USA](https://2ndstreetusa.com/)
<img width="1440" alt="2ndStreet" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100739150/193945646-544df45e-6eaf-44dd-8f4a-c4b74416dab6.png">

2nd Street is a second-hand clothing store with many locations across the USA and Japan. This website belongs to the USA branch and contains information about the company as well as how to sell clothes to them. Additionally, users can shop from the website online. 

#### Overall evaluation: 
The website is intimidating at first glance because the home page basically contains all components that can be found throughout the website juxtaposed next to each other. It almost felt a little too animated at some points as well. Since the text and colors are also very bold, it can feel overwhelming to look at. If users manage to stay and check out other pages besides the home page, then it's easy to find what you need because there's not too much information to sort through. However, the styling of the website can be improved. If the website contained more information with this same organizational form and styling, it might not be as intuitive to navigate. With the changes outlined below, users will have a much better experience using this webpage.

#### Detailed evaluation:

|Heuristic & Description|Evaluation|Recommendation| Severity Rating|
|-----------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
|**1. Visibility of system status:** Users should be able to quickly identify at any point where they are in the system/what state it is in with the help of relevant feedback.|**Good**: In the Locations page, the store location that is selected is highlighted and simultaneously the map zooms into that location. **Bad:** There is no constant text present that shows which page the user is on. And the Navigation Bar isn't highlighted on the page that the user is on. Even when shopping online here, it is not instantly evident which part of the site the user is on.|It would he helpful to highlight the text in the Navigation Bar for the page that the user is currently on.|2|
|**2. Match between system and the real world:** The design follows natural, real-world conventions and utilizes copy and concepts that are familiar to the user.|**Good:** Everything is easy to understand on the website as the language used is pretty casual.|Because the copy on the website is similar to how people would talk with their friends, it's really user-friendly.|0|
|**3. User control and freedom:** Users should have a clear, easy way to exit or undo an unwanted action. |**Bad:** There's no form of a back button or trail to retrace when users want to go back. Only when users scroll up to the nav bar, that's when they see all pages of the website.|Implement a navigation menu on the side containing the main elements including how to sell and shopping online, that will be visible even as users scroll down.|3|
|**4. Consistency and standards:** Established industry standards are followed, in addition to ensuring that there is consistency within the product itself.|**Good:** **Bad:** The bottom of every page on the website that contains links to Lookbook, Articles, Careers, etc. presents the links in extremely large font, while it usually is very small for most websites.|It would be better to reduce the size here because users might get confused on the significance of this portion of the page.|1|
|**5. Error prevention:** The design should prevent errors from happening in the first place by removing error-prone conditions and providing warnings otherwise.|**Good:** There is no functionality on this web page for users to sell their clothes back to 2nd Street online.|Because this functionality doesn't exist, it blocks the potential for errors in the first place.|0|
|**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Users are provided with information that helps them recognize interface components, instead of having to remember and recall from elsewhere.|**Bad:** When hovering over different options in the nav bar, an infinite scrolling bar shows up that mentions different things that can be sold. This places a huge cognitive load on users as they have to take a moment to read what's showing up in the scrolling bar. Since no icons or symbolic images are used in the website, navigation is not as fast as it could be. |Remove the infinite scrolling bar at the very least. It would also be helpful to include some sort of icons for each functionality like selling versus shopping, instead of excessive use of animation.|2|
|**7. Flexibility and efficienty of use:** Shortcuts are enabled for experienced users. |**Good:** There is a shortcut to find store locations under the How to Sell page after a little scrolling, which is useful because users can only sell at the store. **Bad:** I expected a link to store locations to be present at the top where it says to "Bring in your stuff".|Include a link to store locations where it says "Come check out one of our locations."|2|
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Unnecessary and irrelevant information should be ommitted.|**Bad:** The main colors used on the webpage are black, red, and white, which are not accessibility friendly. Also, featuring articles on the home page seems to add to the cluttered feel, especially since users often ignore reading articles.|Choose contrasting but accessible colors, or switch the white text on black background to be black text on white background. Also, I think it would be better to remove article snippets from the homepage.|2|
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Users are provided with error messages that clearly indicate the problem and suggested solution.|**Good:** A message is displayed when users try to log into their account to shop online but enter incorrect username/password. **Bad:** The system does not differentiate between credentials being incorrect versus the account for those credentials not even existing in the first place. |Implement functionality such that the system can recognize when the account doesn't even exist and will prompt the user to first create an account.|2|
|**10. Help and documentation:** Design in a way that users can navigate the interface intuitively. But if documentation is needed, provide it in the relevant area. |**Good:** The website provides several FAQs which should be sufficient for the user to get the information needed when deciding to utilize the service.|No improvements need to be made here because of the thorough collection of FAQs.|0|
