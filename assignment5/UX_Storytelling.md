# DH110 Assignment 5 - Personas and Scenarios

### Purpose of UX Storytelling

When designing digital experiences, it is crucial to keep the most important individual--the user--at the forefront of one's decisions. UX storytelling facilitates this important aspect because through this, we look at the problem/solution space through potential users' eyes in order to empathize with them and develop solutions that would directly target their problems and effectively improve their lives. 

## Improving FoodCycle LA's Website

After analyzing the results of previously conducted research, I would like to implement the following features in my design solution: 
* More accurate food-pantry locator - will provide nearest food pantries that can be determined using the user's current location, with the ability to filter out pantries/kitchens based on specific desired criteria, such as distance, hours of operation, services provided, eligible demographic, etc. 
* Food Composting service - a systematic way that connects those with compostable materials to those providing composting services. Composting services would provide the registered business with a special bin to throw their compostable scraps in, and the business will choose how frequently the service should collect the bin contents. Based on the frequently and volume of collection, users of this service will be incentivized for their effort to improve sustainable consumption patterns.

## User Scenarios and Journey Maps

### 1. Dylan's Scenario 
**Food Pantry Locator**
> Allows users in need of food to quickly locate food pantries or kitchens that are appropriate for their personal circumstances.

**Why** 

Dylan came from a respectable family and was living a priviledged life until highschool, where he had access to so many things and experiences that most others his age didn't have. Once he joined university, he found himself slowly drifting into a bad group of friends, not realizing the effects they would have on him. Because of these very 'friends', Dylan ended up in prison for a crime that he personally didn't do. It took around 4 years for him to finally come out. Since Dylan came out of prison, his family has disassociated themselves from him in all ways possible and refused to let him come back home. Without a home and without solid education beyond high school, Dylan is far behind many of his peers, especially considering how his family’s social circle consisted of high-achievers. Considering his background, Dylan is too embarrassed to ask any of his old friends if he could stay with them either. Although Dylan has lost a good amount of time, care, and respect from his family and community, what he hasn’t lost is his drive and motivation to get back on track and become someone his parents would be proud of. He is determined to get a job with the education that he does have, so that he can make some money to get food on the table and save up a little to pursue a college degree again. He spends his days in areas with free Wi-Fi so that he can work on job applications using his few belongings – his cellphone and laptop. But until he lands this job, he is mainly relying on free food from food pantries and similar resources. It’s important to him that he is able to access food from these resources on a regular basis because if he doesn’t nurture himself physically, that will set him back even further from fulfilling his higher needs to become independent and established in society.  

**How** 

Dylan clicks the ‘Find Food’ tab and opens up the food pantry locator on the website. He is met with an interactive map of the Los Angeles region, where he predominantly moves around. There is a search bar that allows him to input an address, as well as a neighboring button to “Use Current Location”. Dylan chooses to use this button since he cannot easily and instantly determine his whereabouts. Upon clicking this button, a list of nearby food pantries appears below, in order of increasing distance from his location. Dylan sees a Filter button appear at the top right of the list, and clicks that because there are way too many food pantries for him to look through each one and determine what’s best for him. He can now choose to filter out results based on distance from current location, hours/days open, services available besides food such as shower facilities, and if there’s any special conditions that must be met to be able to use the resources at that location. Dylan chooses to filter by hours, as he must go for open interviews at Sprouts Farmers Market from 3-4pm, so he wants something that’s open at least until 5pm. He also wants a place with hot, fresh food, because he’s been living off canned food the past few days. He filters for places with fresh food as well and gets a resulting list of 2 pantries that would work. Dylan is now relieved that after his interview he’ll be able to get a warm meal and wind down for the day.

### 2. Brandon's Scenario 
**Food Composting Service**
> Allows users to build a profile based on the type and frequency of compostable waste they produce. Once their profile is created, it will match them with food composting services that are compatible for their needs. Users will have the option to go dispose their waste at these composting sites, or have the composting service provide them with bins that they will regularly collect from. 

**Why** 

Coming from a background with a deep history and involvement in food production and food service, Brandon knows the value of food and the effort that it takes to produce it. His early positive experiences with food led him to pursue a career as a chef in a restaurant focused on using fresh produce, which he is so fulfilled by. However, his experiences in the mainstream food industry have opened his eyes to the amount of wastage and carelessness behind food consumption patterns. Although Brandon is not personally in control for the restaurant’s produce stock, he feels guilty seeing the amount that gets wasted so effortlessly. He tries to encourage the staff in charging of stocking the pantry to be more careful about how much and what they order, but there is only so much he can do. Another aspect is that even if the restaurant is careful not to waste behind the scenes, customers often waste food that others obviously cannot eat once touched. This ends up going to the trash as well. This is why Brandon wants to find a way to discard spoiled/inedible food and produce so that it doesn’t just contribute to landfills, but can at least get composted and utilized in a beneficial manner. 

**How** 

Brandon hears from a fellow chef how they are dealing with food wastage in their restaurant using the Food Composting service on this website. Brandon decides to go on the website and clicks on the Donate Food tab. On this page, there is an option to donate consumable food as well as inedible food that has to be given to composting services. He clicks on the composting option, which takes him to a web form in which he enters details about his restaurant and the type and frequency of compostable items they have to donate. The Food Composting service maintains a database on the backend of different programs accepting and performing different types of composting. So the service will match Brandon’s newly created profile to potential programs and suggest the program that would be suitable for him. While creating his profile, Brandon will also input whether someone from the restaurant will drop off the donation scraps or if it needs to be picked up. If it needs to be picked up, then he will be provided with compost bins that the restaurant can collect scraps in that will be picked up by the composting service on selected days and times. In this manner, the restaurant will have a systematic procedure to handle food wastage. 

Additionally, this service will use technology such as machine learning to determine percentages / amounts of produce to reduce when ordering stock, in order to minimize wastage. This will be determined by using information from Brandon's profile creation about what types of waste the restaurant produces, combined with statistics on the frequency of waste pickup. This will allow restaurants to minimize food wastage in the first place. 

By combining the food waste minimizing feature along with the composting service pair-up, this feature that enables donating inedible food would be crucial in reducing unsustainable food consumption patterns.
