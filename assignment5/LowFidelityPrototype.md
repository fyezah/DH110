# DH110 Assignment 5 - Low Fidelity Prototype

### Description of Project:

In this project, I will be redesigning the Foodcycle LA website, which belongs to a non-profit organization centered around reducing food wastage and food insecurity. Through this redesign, I hope to facilitate a better user experience and improve the website's overall design. This website provides services that are utilized by two different segments of users: users looking to donate in some form and users looking to receive food. Through my previous user research and formation of personas and scenarios, I was able to identify certain features that would be valuable to improve. Below, you will find more detail on what I have discovered and how I hope to implement appropriate changes. 

**User Research** 

Based on my contextual inquiry and user research, I uncovered some insights that serve as an inspiration for what improvements could be made to the website. I had one user simply navigate through the website to complete certain tasks like identifying what types of food can be donated and locating a food pantry in a specific location. This showed me how the organization of the website can be difficult at certain times, as well as how the food pantry locator was not as user-friendly as possible. Upon interviewing other small food business owners, I further solidified my intent to improve the food pantry locator as this was something they also had difficulty using. From this interview, another important highlight was the idea that small businesses have different consumption patterns than large businesses, and so their needs vary. What this means is that small business owners are often more careful to prevent wastage and are pretty successful at doing so, except when it comes to food/produce that is no longer edible. However, large businesses don't have the time or need to be that careful with their resources, and thus likely produce a lot more wastage ofboth edible and inedible food. 

**Personas and Scenarios** 

Taking the insights uncovered from my user research, I then developed two personas and scenarios: 
* Dylan - a young adult who just came out prison and is unhoused and trying to rebuild his life again. Therefore, he is currently relying on food pantries to sustain himself. 
* Brandon - a chef at a large restaurant focused on using the best produce for their food. With a background rooted in food, Brandon realizes the importance of valuing food no matter how abundant it may be, and thus wants to reduce restaurant food wastage and reduce the guilt he feels every time he sees how much is being wasted. 

**Tasks/Features**

1. Food pantry locator that uses current location to provide a list of viable options that can be filtered based on requirements
2. Food composting program pairing donors with food composting services nearby

**Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototype**

By creating a low-fidelity prototype of my design solution, I can quickly visualize how I want these features to look and test my design's efficiency with users so that important changes can be made at this stage itself before putting in the time to build the final prototype and product for release. 

### Wireframes and Wireflows

**Wireframes**

**Wireflows**

### Protoype testing

The tester was able to successfully complete both tasks. You can find a video of me testing the protoype with the user [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AOAl8chZQdWoby3uc99FeZGbO-xd-Dtl/view?usp=sharing)

*Please note that we forgot to switch the highlighter color for the second task while testing. Therefore, I had the user go back afterwards and mark those points again with a pink highlighter. I have included a picture below.*

### Reflection

My experience testing with a low-fidelity prototype was enjoyable overall as it felt like one of the most tangible steps of the UX design/research process where we can see our solution almost come to life. It didn't take too long for the user to complete the tasks, which I'm interpreting as a good sign that there's not too many steps/too much information that the user has to sort through to get to what's needed.

To be completely honest, I was surprised to find myself a little stressed preparing these wireframes as I realized that I don't really enjoy sketching, especially when the sketch is depended on to solve a problem because there's so much more value added to it as opposed to just randomly doodling, for example. I found it a little stressful to know that the user's experience was kind of at stake depending on these drawings. But on a positive note, the whole point of low-fidelity testing is to uncover flaws in the early stages of the design process so that high-fidelity protoypes are polished and allow for a smooth and successful user experience. 

During the testing, I expected the user to have a little more trouble following the arrows in the wireflow, but was suprised to see how she easily did it. 
I feel that I did a fairly thorough job showing the different possible interactions in my wireflow, so I'm hoping that made it easier for the user. However, the user did seem to get overwhelmed when getting to the area of the wireflow where there's a lot of overlapping arrows and components to keep track of. To address this, next time I would probably have each wireframe on a separate small square of paper so that I can move them around until satisfied with the flow/grouping and then perhaps paste it on a larger piece of cardstock. Since I used multiple sheets of regular printer paper for this, I had to plan before drawing the frames, but I sometimes realized after that it might have been easier to draw a certain frame in a different place. This is something the user also mentioned, as she asked why a certain related frame was all the way at the end when it should be next to the homepage. That was simply because I added it in later and could only put it in that section due to space constraints. 

As for revisions to the actual prototype based on feedback received, the most important area to revise is the food pantry locator frames, as the user stated this was confusing overall. At the point when the user got to the Advanced Search frame, I realized that there was a disconnect between the address search bar and the filters to sort out results by. I realized this is also why the user didn't interact which the main address search bar; but at the same time, the advanced search did not include any field to input address. The user got stuck at this point for a little bit, and I realize that was because I did not include a 'save' or 'apply filters' button for the advanced search. I would have to add one of these buttons and probably modify the 'distance' input area to have 2 possible input options: distance from current location, which would obviously utilize the user's current location, or distance from address, in which the user would input a different address as well as the desired distance the user wants to search within. Another way to handle this gap between the address search bar and advanced search section would be to change the advanced search into a 'Filter' button that is linked with the appearing results after the user performs the initial search in the main search bar. But this might feel more tedious as the user would have to search just based on address and then go in and filter afterwards. Both would technically be the same amount of work, but the second way might mentally feel like more work. 

I would also add titles of the main interactions possible from each wireframe because there were some frames like the Donate landing page where the user was unsure about how it would relate or be navigated to from other pages.
