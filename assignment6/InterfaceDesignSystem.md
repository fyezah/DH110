# DH110 Assignment 6 - Interface Design System

## Description of Project

This project will be redesigning the FoodCycle LA website's food pantry locator and introducing a new feature faciliating food composting services within the LA region, in hopes of reducing food wastage and encouraging sustainable consumption patterns in society, all while enabling those in need of food to easily get their needs fulfilled. In this interface design assignment, I will be redesigning the 'Find Food' landing page, which will then lead into the food pantry locator page. 

### Purpose of Interface Design: 

Interface design is a useful procedural component of the UX design process as designers get to play around with different colors, typography, and layouts in order to identify the most appealing, elegant design solution which can then be translated to all other pages so that the overall product is cohesive. 

### Design Process: 
The method I utilized to create this interface design was that I started with a digitized low-fidelity wireframe of one screen of my design, as pictured below.

Then I first performed the layout test by adding in columns and rows to guide the placement of different components. Afterwards, I tested different typographies and selected my preferred typographic variation, which I then used to test different shape variations. After selecting my preferred shape variation, I used that design to test light and dark color schemes on. After selecting my preferred color scheme, I performed an impression test and made some changes to arrive at the final design pictured at the end. The full screen design tests can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AIWUz3wq2udTVCUZK23VYK/Design-System%3A-FoodCycle-LA?node-id=5%3A503).

## Impression Test

To check the effectiveness of this design and if it accomplishes what I intended, I performed an impression test with a user, asking her to provide her thoughts on the screen after viewing it for 5 seconds. Here is the [transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHtzjzWSBfsyAYIUSF2kxtUCWd9uDFOfXNl8CRnMSKw/edit?usp=sharing) of the testing session. 

Overall, the user said the page seems pretty straightword and isn't too cluttered. However, she suggested some aesthetic improvements such as adding a banner to the header or footer area to make it more appealing, as well as changing the font of the "Individuals" and "Non-Profits" buttons. 

The bigger issue I found here was that the user thought clicking on the buttons would just take them to perhaps a full page of testimonials from individuals or non-profits that would convince the user to work with FoodCycle LA. I was surprised to hear that the user didn't expect the same functionality from these buttons that I thought was very intuitive, ie. that clicking on the "Individuals" button would take them to the food pantry locator, so I would like to test this same design with others as well and see if they think the same. But in the meantime, the design would benefit from adding a "Testimonials" heading in the testimonials boxes. Additionally, it might be helpful to add a little more textual description saying something like "If you're an individual looking for food, click here." or "if you're a non-profit collecting food, click here." 

## Accessibility and Color-Contrast Check
