        <h1 class="display-4"><i>Website Redesign</i></h1> 
        <p class="lead">by Faizah Mohamed, DH110 Fall 2022</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Foodcycle LA is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles that aims to reduce food wastage and make food accessible for all. In this project, I redesign an existing feature of the FoodCycle LA site and add a new food composting feature to improve the user experience for both those looking to find food as well as those looking to handle their food more responsibly. With food being one of the most basic necessities of mankind, oftentimes not a lot of thought is given to how it’s being produced and consumed. Through this redesign, I hope to facilitate and inspire more responsible consumption in society, as outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 of Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>

          <h2 class="display-6">Design Statement</h2>
          <p>As the global population continues to increase, it is now more important than ever to ensure that we use our limited natural resources responsibly. Various global crises we are facing today, including climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are greatly affected by humans’ unsustainable patterns of consumption (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12).</p>
            <p>One of the main areas where the global community is involved in unsustainable consumption is when it comes to food. Over 30% of the world's food is getting wasted-- with 13.3% getting lost post-harvest before reaching the market, and an even greater percentage, ie. 17%, being wasted once in consumers' possession (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12). Unless the global community takes action to become responsible consumers, we will only exacerbate problems like food shortages and landfill growth, damaging the planet that has been so generous to us. 
            </p>
            <p>FoodCycle LA is a great organization that works towards this cause. However, the current website might not be as effective as possible in converting website visitors to actual users of the site’s features, due to possible limitations in the site’s design and features. My project will redesign aspects of the site to improve the user experience and be more inviting and streamlined for those looking to responsibly handle food recycling as well as those looking to find food. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
            <p class="card-text">To first get an understanding of how existing solutions in the sustainable consumption domain are operating, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of two websites: <a href="https://www.foodcyclela.org/">FoodCycle LA</a>, which focuses on sustainable food consumption and <a href="https://2ndstreetusa.com/">2nd Street USA</a>, a sustainable second-hand clothing store. I chose websites from 2 different categories (food vs. clothing) to see which category needs better solutions so I can focus my project in that area. After analyzing both websites against the 10 Usability Heuristics detailed by the N/N Group, I found that the FoodCycle LA site, while functional, could use a lot of improvements in terms of user control/freedom, flexibility, and efficiency, especially since the website felt repetitive and difficult to navigate at times. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Usability Testing</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Based on what I gathered from the heuristic evaluation, I created 3 tasks for users to complete to test the website’s usability. The tasks involve using the food pantry locator, donating money, and navigating through the website to find guidelines on what can be donated. While the usability testing proved that some of the issues I faced were also faced by other users, I learned that not every  issue I had was uncovered by other users as well. This highlighted to me what issues were worth spending effort on as I continue the process of my website redesign. </p>

              <p class="card-text">With an idea in mind of what issues I wanted to focus on, like the food pantry locator, for example, I still needed to hear from target users what problems <i>they</i> personally encounter and need solutions for, as designs are only as effective as the problems they solve for the intended users specifically. I conducted a contextual inquiry with a mother-daughter duo that owns a catering business, to hear about their experiences with food wastage. 
              <p>This user research unveiled new insights I hadn’t thought of before, such as how organizations’ social media presence matters, how large businesses have different food consumption patterns compared to small businesses, and the stronger need to appropriately handle inedible food because that’s what gets trashed more often.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">UX Storytelling</h5>
            <p class="card-text">When designing digital experiences, it is crucial to keep the most important individual--the user--at the forefront of one's decisions. UX storytelling facilitates this by allowing us to look at problem/solution space through potential users' eyes in order to empathize with them and develop solutions that would directly target their problems and effectively improve their lives. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Taking the insight I gained from the contextual inquiry, I developed two user personas and empathy maps to paint the picture of target users’ goals, motivations, pain points, and their values, actions, and expectations. I then created a scenario for each type of user to benefit from the features I’m redesigning–namely the food pantry locator and a new food composting feature. I then outlined a journey map of their probable thought process and actions from start to finish as they navigate through the scenario.

            <p class="card-text">Based on the user personas, scenarios, and tasks that I created, I hand-sketched a low-fidelity prototype to support two features, namely: 
                <li>Food pantry locator that uses current location to provide a list of viable options that can be filtered based on requirements</li>
                <li>Food composting program pairing donors with food composting services nearby.</li></p>
                <p>I then tested the prototype with a user to get feedback on whether the task flows were intuitive and complete.This testing uncovered some confusing areas for the food pantry locator, which I revised in upcoming versions of the prototype.</p>

I also conducted an impression test on this design system and ensured that it was accessible and conforming to WCAG standards by passing all color contrast checks.

                <p class="card-text">I developed a high fidelity interactive prototype on Figma that would closely resemble the final product by applying my interface design system to the low fidelity prototype. I simultaneously made some changes to the food pantry locator feature upon suggestions received from user testing done on the low fidelity prototype stating that this feature was a bit confusing. 
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">I then had classmates perform a cognitive walkthrough on this prototype, which uncovered areas to modify and add interactions to, such as being able to click the logo to go back to the home page, adding dummy screens to show food pantry results getting filtered, and adding location markers on the map.</p>
                <p class="card-text">I made the suggested changes in the second iteration of the prototype, the mobile version of which is linked below.</p>

    <p>Looking at the results of all the usability testing overall, I concluded that the prototype was intuitive and easy to use except when it comes to using the search bar vs. current location to find food pantries. 
    Therefore, I improved this feature for the final version by explicitly including an option in the search bar to search using current location, while still maintaining the functionality of the search icon.<br>Another minor change I made was to show what step of the food composting signup procedure users are at, so they know how much is left for them to do.<br>Last but not least, I also included another
dummy screen of the food composting profile filled up, just so the prototype feels more realistic. All these changes can be viewed in the Final Design prototype below.  </p>

    <div class="card-deck" style="padding: 4%;">
    <p>Overall, the process I undertook to redesign the FoodCycle LA website has been very fulfilling. Although my prototype certainly is not perfect, I'm happy with how it has developed over the past few weeks. 
        The UX Design process that I understook to complete this project involves various components, which is what makes it appealing for people coming from many different backgrounds. 
        This also means that each UX researcher/designer would find some parts easier to do than others, depending on their personal strengths. My experiences as I worked on this project revealed to me my passion for empathizing with users 
        and seeking to truly understand their experiences. What was surprising, however, was that as much as I love creative endeavors, I found the actual designing part to be more difficult and almost a little stressful, perhaps because 
        we had to ensure not only that we are happy with our solutions as designers, but that they actually fulfill the job we intend to do. This is where feedback from others has been so valuable, as things are not always as easy to understand to others as the designer might feel. Nevertheless, my journey 
        with this project has given me a solid understanding and foundational skills across the UX design process, starting with empathizing with users and defining the problem space, ultimately resulting in a functional prototype that is tested and 
        will hopefully be implemented.</p>
    <p>As I reflect on what I have learned through the course of this project, my experience working on this project has taught me that there is a need to prioritize what features are worth working on in the interest of time. Although we may come up with many ideas to make our prototype 
        as fascinating as possible, it is not always feasible to fully build everything out. So we have to prioritize and decide what would bring the most impact for the user. On the same note, different users have different preferences and views, so it will not 
        always be possible to accomodate every suggestion given to us as designers. Again, we have to analyze the pros and cons of each and ideally make our decisions based on research to determine which suggestions to implement. While these skills are highly 
        important in UI/UX research especially, it is arguably as important in any other career as well. Ultimately, this project has given me a firm understanding and foundational knowledge of how to carry out UX research, while equipping me with skills to succeed
        in any field I choose to enter in the future.
