# DH110 Assignment 2 - Pilot Usability Testing

## Introduction

Usability testing is a crucial component of a UX Researcher/Designer's work in order to ensure that a product is highly efficient, effective, and satisfactory. In other words, usability testing is important to ensure high usability, because no matter how much data one collects from users using the product, usability testing is the best way get a detailed evaluation of the product directly from the user's perspective since users themselves are observed as they navigate the website to complete a specific set of tasks. In the process of the testing session, researchers will be able to uncover any pain points as well as elements that facilitate effective, easy use of the website, which the researcher can then take into consideration to redesign and improve the experience that users have with the site.  

Based on my previous heuristic evaluation and subsequent exploration of the [FoodcycleLA site](https://www.foodcyclela.org/), I found the following issues to be most severe: 
* **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** 
  * The menu bar at the top has the site organized into major divisions, but does not contain detailed information on what can be found in each section of the site. This might make it difficult to efficiently navigate through the site. I attempt to test this aspect through Task 3 as users are told to find a specific set of guidelines that cannot be located directly from the menu bar. 
  * It was difficult to find food pantries in relevant areas because there is no way to search based on current location and filter out results based on necessary conditions. This is tested in Task 2 as the user is asked to find food pantries within a certain distance of a specific location that will be open at a specific time.
* **User Control and Freedom:** Users might be stuck on the money donation page if they close the modal donation form as there is no redirection back to the website. This is tested in Task 1 as the user is told to close the money donation form and locate a different form. 

### Methodology 

To test these issues, I recruited an adult as similar to the target user as I could - a working adult, someone who's not currently in school. The testing session was conducted remotely from my laptop over Zoom, during which I shared the testing material in the form of a Google Forms survey containing the link to the website and the following components: 
* Introduction and Informed Consent Form
* Background questions
* Pre-test questions
* 3 tasks to explore the above-mentioned issues
* Post-test questionnaire
* Product satisfaction cards
* Demographic questions

I was the moderator who guided the user as she navigated the website and input relevant data into the Google Form. The session was recorded from Zoom for future analysis and to be a point of reference to come back to. This is just a pilot run to test if the materials and process are suitable for actual testing.

## Reflection 

During the pilot test, I learned that much of the issues I experienced were also faced by the user, as she also found the website to be busy, making it not as efficient to find the things needed. While the site is functional overall, it seems that making improvements to areas like the menu bar content would make it even easier to navigate. The participant also voiced different aesthetic pain points, such as the menu bar text blending into the background, not being able to see a larger portion of the drop-down addresses when searching for food pantries, etc. It was interesting to observe when the user closed the money donation form as asked, she closed the whole tab instead of the modal window. Perhaps since I was evaluating the website initially with more scrutiny, I wanted to test closing the modal window. But that was not the instinctive thing to do for the participant. This made me understand how even when conducting heuristic evaluation, we should do it from the user's perspective and not from the perspective that we are simply trying to uncover any flaws that exist, as not all flaws hinder usability.

What went well: The participant spoke aloud as she navigated throughout the website, which was really helpful to understand her thought process in why she took the actions that she did. Since she was my friend, it was not awkward between us, which facilitated better communication and therefore better results from the session. The participant was also determined to complete the tasks so she tried as much as she could and accomplished everything except for finding food pantries in a specific area (Task 2). Also, I felt that I did a good job stepping in at appropriate times to guide the user because we had open communication between us, so she felt comfortable speaking aloud and I also guided her without trying to interfere in her actions too much. 

Future improvements: Since it was my first UT test as a moderator, I felt that I didn't conduct the testing session as smoothly as I could have. I sometimes drifted away from the script and summarized directions in my own words. Then upon realizing I already had the script in the survey form, I would try to convey those instructions as well, which made the moderation not as smooth. We also experienced some internet connectivity issues, which seemed to make the participant slightly stressed at certain points. Since I was outdoors during the session, there was a lot of background noise at certain points. To improve my testing in the future, I would like to make sure to double check my survey material for any errors before the session, as I found a few minor errors during our session. Additionally, I need to get used to sticking to the script in the survey material.
