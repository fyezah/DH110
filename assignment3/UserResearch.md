# Assignment 4 - User Research
### DH110 Fall 2022 with Dr. Sookie Cho

## Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

>This project will support specific activities for two different segments of users: those wanting to donate as well as those who are in need. This project will enable donaters to more easily donate food or time by serving as volunteers who transport donated food to appropriate centers of distribution. 
Additionally, it will facilitate an easier search process for users trying to locate food pantries accessible to them. Through these efforts, the project ultimately aims to support more sustainable food consumption patterns in order to prevent wastage that further contributes to various planetary crises we are facing today. 

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)**

>These activities support humans' basic physiological need of food by ensuring that excess food is not wasted and can instead be directed towards other individuals who are in need. 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

>Currently, there are different food banks, soup kitchens, and shelters where individuals can drop off canned food or go to the location and prepare food there. However, options to donate prepared food and recycle unedible food are limited. Further, resources consolidating information on where to find food and related services in the area for those in need are limited in functionality, as many resources simply provide the location, hours of operation, and phone number for these places. In order to get a better idea of available services, users would have to contact each place to see if their needs can be fulfilled at that location. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**

>Limitations for donating food include the fact that there is not a common, formal system that restaurants, for example, can utilize to donate excess food at the end of the day. Unless there is something scheduled to routinely collect this food and take it to appropriate centers where it could be utilized in a beneficial way, this excess food will most likely end up in landfills. Digital technology would help solve this issue by connecting donors with volunteers who can regularly take the time out to allocate these resources in appropriate places. 
When it comes to those looking to find food, a limitation is that they might not have an exact address to input into food bank locators to find places nearby. Through digital technology, enabling the use of current location would make the search process much easier and streamlined.

## Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users?**
>* Demographics: students or adults working/volunteering in the food industry
>* Preference: users that would like to contribute back to their local community to create more tangible, accessible impact
>* Expertise: Users wouldn't need a specific level of expertise to utilize this website. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would probably donate food at the end of the day from their work/volunteer location, whether that may be a restaurant or other event that has excess food to donate, for example.

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?** 
>Users would typically take the packaged excess food and personally drive it to a food bank that accepts donations. 

## Research Methods
To get more insight into the target users' wants and needs, I performed contextual inquiry through interviewing and observing a participant group consisting of two people who very closely fit my target demographic. The interview was conducted over Zoom because of the distance between me and the users; but this shouldn't be a problem as the location would not significantly impact users' answers and prior experiences. During the interview, I first asked both participants some background questions. I then had them perform a task to search for an organization that would be suitable to help them donate food in their specific circumstances. I asked guiding questions during this time and took notes on paper as I observed the participant. Finally, I asked some follow-up and closing questions to conclude. 
  
### Materials 
I put together a [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDTS4Vg5NW331ulSi_rL4_TScRL6wJ4pvvdy3RWCKQw/edit?usp=sharing) beforehand including some questions to cover during the interview.

## Interview Insights

* **While edible food is rarely wasted by the participants, inedible food does end up in the trash.**

  The participants interviewed seemed to be pretty good at preventing food wastage as long as the food was edible. But when asked about what they do when left with food that can no longer be consumed, here's what they said:  
  >"We havenâ€™t really thought of, or, uh, looked into a bunch of composting services. We would like to do that. But yes, uh, we do just end up trashing them for that." 

* **The importance of organizations having an active social media presence:**
  >"Post more about it on social media, because a lot of us, I guess, have to find it to donate it. But if it's like more over social media, if it's more emphasized, I feel like people will be reminded about it, because sometimes we forget. So when you're reminded about it, I feel like you tend to do it more. But like, if you were to um, yeah, people search it up, but not everyone has it to search it up. When you see it I feel like it reminds you. So maybe be more open on other platforms."
  
  Based on my observation of the participant searching for an organization that accepts prepared food donations, it felt like a very tedious process. If it wasn't for the fact that the participant was currently being interviewed, I'm not sure if she would have stuck through with the task until she found a place. Applying this to a larger audience, if it's this difficult to find a suitable organization, people might not be willing to search in the first place. But when such organizations are shown to individuals on social media without any effort on the individuals' part, that might result in more action being taken to utilize these organizations. 

* **Big businesses having different food consumption behavior compared to small businesses:**
  >"I would say, for big businesses, even if we are not such a big business, but for more bigger, I would say it would definitely be easier, you know, just to throw it and move on, and especially if they have, um, money and stuff. I don't think it really matters too much to them. Plus, um, usually when you're a bigger business, you don't really have much time even to go and donate it too."

## Reflection

Planning and conducting this contextual inquiry felt both easier and harder than prior research that I conducted with users. It was more difficult in the sense that although I made a script and questions ahead of time to use in the interview, I had to modify it on the spot during the interview depending on the answers and feedback the users were providing me with, as it would not have made sense if I strictly adhered to the script. It was not like the usability testing where there were fixed tasks and questions that the user would have to answer regardless. 

This experience also reinforced for me the importance of assuring participants whenever conducting any form of research or interview with them that we are not trying to evaluate or find flaws in them; rather, we are trying better understand their wants and needs in order to help them. This is because before I started the interview, the participants expressed some concerns about whether their situation is suitable for being interviewed. I had to reassure them that there is no such thing as good/right or bad/wrong here, and that I just wanted to hear about their personal experiences, whatever that may be.

One thing I would do differently next time is that I would like to conduct such interviews in person because it would avoid problems like internet connectivity issues and would make communication between the researcher and participant more natural and seamless. I would also try to do a couple interviews with participants on different ends of the spectrum of my target user, to get a more holistic picture of the problems that are faced in this space. For example, in this interview I spoke with target users having experience in a small food business. But our conversation revealed that users coming from a big business might have a different set of issues.

Overall, this interview helped uncover for me some of the common needs and behaviors of target users that I will be able to address in my own design.
