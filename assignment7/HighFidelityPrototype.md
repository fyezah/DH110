# Assignment 7 - High Fidelity Prototype
### DH110 Fall 2022 with Dr. Sookie Cho

## Overview

This project will be redesigning the FoodCycle LA website to add a new food composting service to it and revamping the food pantry locator to make it easier for users to interact with. This is all in hopes of reducing food wastage, making food for accessible to all, and increasing sustainable consumption patterns. This document contains the first draft of a high-fidelity interactive prototype, which allows us to test the design solution with users as if it was already released, so that we can get final bits of feedback before handing off the final design to developers. I first hand drew low-fidelity prototypes, which I then digitized. Thereafter, I created an interface design system after testing various typographies, shapes, and color schemes. I then applied this design system to the high fidelity prototype which you will find below. 

## Tasks

1. Signing up to utilize FoodCycle LA's food composting service
2. Using the food pantry locate to find pantries/kitchens near the user that meet any required conditions
