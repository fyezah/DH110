# Assignment 7 - High Fidelity Prototype
### DH110 Fall 2022 with Dr. Sookie Cho

## Overview

This project will be redesigning the FoodCycle LA website to add a new food composting service to it and revamping the food pantry locator to make it easier for users to interact with. This is all in hopes of reducing food wastage, making food for accessible to all, and increasing sustainable consumption patterns. This document contains the first draft of a high-fidelity interactive prototype, which allows us to test the design solution with users as if it was already released, so that we can get final bits of feedback before handing off the final design to developers. I first hand drew low-fidelity prototypes, which I then digitized. Thereafter, I created an interface design system after testing various typographies, shapes, and color schemes. I then applied this design system to the high fidelity prototype which you will find below. 

## Tasks

1. Signing up to utilize FoodCycle LA's food composting service
2. Using the food pantry locate to find pantries/kitchens near the user that meet any required conditions

### Below is my wireflow with graphic design:

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Cognitive Walkthrough Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LKiJNKPtAOERItR_wTRY5I26FO-41tWdb4_dKc10xVE/edit?usp=sharing)

The above data was obtained from cognitive walkthroughs carried out during class with two of my classmates. I first gave the reviewers background on my user personas and scenarios, and then showed them my prototype and asked them to complete the task of locating a food pantry with given restraints. 

While both participants were able to quickly navigate through the mobile site to complete the given task, there were important areas of improvement that they pointed out. The most important suggestion was that <b>certain actions were inaccessible or unclickable, such as the search function and the back buttons.</b>

> Improvement: I need to add interactions to my prototype at these points like the back button and perhaps add an overlay for the search bar. I will also add an interaction to the logo so that clicking on it takes the user back to the home page

They also suggested to include more detail in the prototype for the food locator, in terms of how the filter function works specifically. 

> Improvement: I will create dummy screens depicting how adding filters will sort out the results. 

Overall, the process was easy to carry out with the help of scripts provided by the instructor to conduct the walkthrough. It was great to receive comments on the Figma prototype itself, as that allows me to see exactly which points can be improved, as opposed to reading through comments from the separate Google Form and matching it to the relevant place of the prototype. 

The above improvements are reflected in the second iteration of the prototype, pictured below.
